# DWM Configs

## Overview 
A collection of files used for my DWM configurations.

### Files
* **dwm.desktop**, a simple xsession file, goes in `/usr/share/xsessions/`.
* **configure.sh**, A BASH script that once completed will put files in place and compile the environment's software on a fresh install.
* **headers**, C Header files for the programs

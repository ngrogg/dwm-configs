# DWM Configs

## Overview
A collection of files used for my DWM configurations.

### Files
* **configure.sh**, A BASH script that once completed will put files in place and compile the environment's software on a fresh install. Designed for Debian. Probably works on most DEB distros.
* **dwm.desktop**, a simple xsession file, goes in `/usr/share/xsessions/`.
* **headers**, C Header files for the programs. Essentially config files.
* **xprofile**, Status bar display. Goes in `~/.xprofile`.
